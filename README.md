# 10 years ago... and somehow, also 10 years from now... 
## Mark Watney, astronaut, is stranded on Mars.  Abandoned, presumed dead by his crew, Mark must survive.
### First, Mark must find suitable dirt and create an organic compost using the crew's biological waste.
### Next comes creating water from left over hydrazine fuel.  Then Mark must grow food in a converted hab to survive until the next phase of the plan.
### Communication with NASA is a must if he hopes to be rescued.  Find the old Pathfinder probe that landed on Mars in the 1990's.  
### In order to make the journey, increase the range of the one working rover and find an alternative source of cabin heat.
### Once Pathfinder is found and brought back to the hab, use the antenna to establish a comm link to Earth and connect to NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
### JPL will have a Pathfinder of their own to test.  Communicate using the Martian probe's camera and robotic mast.
### Decode rotational angles into hexadecimals and then into ASCII text.  Decipher instructions to hack the rover's firmware and to send text messages back and forth.
### Back at NASA, launch a resupply probe on the Iris booster rocket and send it direct to Mars.
### Meanwhile, in interplanetary space, the Hermes carries the Ares III crew back to Earth.  Find a faster path to rescue Mark with a slingshot manuever that will intercept with the resupply probe.  
### Get the Hermes back to Mars before Mark runs out of food.  Mark will need to get to Schiaparelli crater and board the pre-stationed Ares IV MAV.  Launch to a fly-by intercept of the Hermes as it swings past Mars.
### The MAV will need to lose quite a bit of weight in order to make intercept velocity.  Rendezvous with the Hermes and use a tether to attach to Mark as he goes EVA from the MAV capsule.  Reunite the Ares III crew.
### Return to Earth orbit with the Hermes and a full crew complement.
